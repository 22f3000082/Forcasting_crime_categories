# 🕵️‍♂️ CrimeCast: Forecasting Crime Categories

Welcome to **CrimeCast**, a machine learning project aimed at predicting crime categories based on historical crime data. This project leverages various machine learning techniques to analyze patterns and trends in crime incidents, enhancing public safety measures and law enforcement strategies.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop predictive models that can accurately classify crime categories using historical crime data. By analyzing various features such as location, time, victim demographics, and more, the models aim to forecast the type of crime that occurred.

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA phase involves:

- Visualizing the distribution of crime categories
- Analyzing temporal patterns (e.g., crimes by hour, day, month)
- Examining geographical distribution using heatmaps
- Investigating relationships between victim demographics and crime types

---

## 🛠️ Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing

Key steps include:

- Handling missing values through imputation
- Encoding categorical variables using techniques like One-Hot Encoding
- Scaling numerical features for uniformity
- Creating new features to capture complex patterns
- Balancing the dataset to address class imbalances

---

## 🤖 Modeling

Multiple machine learning algorithms are employed, such as:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- XGBoost
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

Model performance is evaluated using metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, and **confusion matrices**.
