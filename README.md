🕵️‍♂️ CrimeCast: Forecasting Crime Categories
Welcome to CrimeCast, a machine learning project aimed at predicting crime categories based on historical crime data. This project leverages various machine learning techniques to analyze patterns and trends in crime incidents, enhancing public safety measures and law enforcement strategies.​

📌 Project Overview
The objective of this project is to develop predictive models that can accurately classify crime categories using historical crime data. By analyzing various features such as location, time, victim demographics, and more, the models aim to forecast the type of crime that occurred.


🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA phase involves:​

Visualizing the distribution of crime categories.

Analyzing temporal patterns (e.g., crimes by hour, day, month).

Examining geographical distribution using heatmaps.

Investigating relationships between victim demographics and crime types.​

🛠️ Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing
Key steps include:​

Handling missing values through imputation.

Encoding categorical variables using techniques like One-Hot Encoding.

Scaling numerical features for uniformity.

Creating new features to capture complex patterns.

Balancing the dataset to address class imbalances.​

🤖 Modeling
Multiple machine learning algorithms are employed, such as:​

Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
XGBoost
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)​

Model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.​

📈 Results & Insights
The best-performing model achieved a significant improvement in predicting crime categories, demonstrating the effectiveness of the feature engineering and modeling techniques applied.​
